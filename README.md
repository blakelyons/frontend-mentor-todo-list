-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to not have to code everything yourself, but it's OK to find a something that works great for the project at the time. Thanks [@David-Desmaisons](https://github.com/SortableJS/vue.draggable.next/commits?author=David-Desmaisons) for the assitance!

### Continued development

Just keep learning, everyday. That's it...
